# create-new-project
Create New Project is a simple and easy-to-use project creation tool.

### Chrome Webdriver is required

### Note : The script requires following environment variables to be configured :
- `PATH` - Add path to chromedriver.exe in path variables
- `GH_DISPLAY_NAME` = Your Display Name (Mostly for License part of README). Any name with or without spaces.
- `GH_NAME` = GitHub Username
- `GH_PASS` = `[5 Random chars] + GitHub Password + [5 Random chars]`

For Example : 
```
[IF] ORIGINAL_PASSWORD :- password
[THEN] GH_PASS :- #0291password$0@30
                  ^^^^^        ^^^^^
                  Notice these random chars
```
> Adding random chars is important for security so that unknown programs do not use this password. This is also a required for the script.

To set these Environment Variables from Terminal use following syntax:
```bash
$ set GH_DISPLAY_NAME=todo
$ set GH_NAME=todo
$ set GH_PASS=todo
```
